        The voices in my head said that a world controller runs a region until his 40th birthday. Nevertheless, because of what Brazil has done to me, I will be the World Controller of region Brazil until my death day. Even If I am abroad, even If i am in a psychiatric hospital.
        <br>
        The voices in my head said that I live my life backwards. I was born old and I am getting younger. Because of that I will be the World Controller of Brazil region until my death day.

        There is information in my mind that unlocks given my conscious and subconscious choices.
        <br>
        There is going to never stop the leaking of information from my mind.
        <br>
        The information leaking depend on situations. If I am in a Justice Court is one kind of information, if I am in a Freemason lodge it is another kind of information, if I am in a doctor office is another kind of information.
        The information only leaks If I am in the situation, if it is another personality there is no leaking of information.
        <br>
        When someone gives an order and the alter yells "free will violation", it is very difficult for me to obtain the memory.

        The longer it takes for me to know the better it is.

            The goal of freemasonry is to teach man about himself.

        <blockquote>
            <i>Great Architect</i> - is the Freemason that has the plan to manipulate the God and the neophyte's faith test. He is always a Freemason from Heaven.
            <br>
            <i>Judge</i> - is the Freemason that rules if the faith test is fair. He is always a Freemason from Hell that is a law enforcement officer in the real world and in the Freemasonry world, like a judge, prosecutor or a lawyer.
            <br>
            <i>God</i> - is the Political/Religious person that destroys the neophyte life.

        <H3>Black Book</H3>
        The black book is a book with the names of all masons that are banished from Freemasonry. To have your name written in the <b>black book</b> is the only way to end your <i>faith test.</i>

        <H3 id="prophecy">Prophecy</H3>
        God write events to happen on the neophyte life. These events should be meaningful. Either spiritually, mentally or materially.
        <br>
        It is always interpreted according to the religion of the neophyte.
        <br>
        During the events, the neophyte must exercise his most precious gift <b>free-will</b>.
        <br>
        The neophyte must fulfill the prophecy book by <b>acting</b> on the events and choosing between virtue and sin.

        <H3>Book of Job</H3>
        The Book of Job from Bible is the faith test.
        <br>
        <blockquote>

            The objective of the faith test is to be a Freemason. The faith test is never over.

        <b>It means reconciliation. During the faith test, the neophyte makes wrong decisions and argue/fight with his beloveds one. At the end, there must be a reconciliation.</b>

        <H3>Religious War</H3>
        The faith test is always a religious war. It is a war of the God's religion and the neophyte's religion.
        <br>
        <b>To the neophyte is a religious experience. He must be faithful to his own religion, not the God's religion.</b>
        <br>
        To everyone else, God, the Freemasons, the future lodge, is a power game.
        <br>
        It is a hidden war between the God and the Freemasons. And the Freemasons profit destroying and saving the life of the neophyte.

        <H4>Sponsorship</H4>
        When the God's religion and the neophyte's religion are the same, it is called Sponsorship and is the worst scenario as possible. God has all the power. God can destroy the neophyte or can be merciful and save him.
        <br>
        In this scenario:
        <ol>
            <li>The neophyte cannot ask for his God help, After all is the same God that is destroying his life.</li>
            <li>The neophyte cannot as for help from his religious community, After all they will help God destroy the neophyte life and will not help the neophyte.</li>
            <li>The Freemasons will play harder, forcing always the destruction of the life of the neophyte for profit. Forcing God do end the faith test.</li>
        </ol>

        <H3>Power game</H3>
        God thinks that is only powerful person playing and is teaching a game of power to the neophyte with the excuse of knowing if he is good or evil.
        God destroys the life of the neophyte and demands conversion to his religion.
        God thinks that he is alone playing the game. In truth, God is playing a power game against the freemasonry.
        <br>
        For everyone involved is a power game - all Freemasons (Heaven and Hell) and political and powerful people.
        <br>
        <b>For the neophyte, it is a religious experience.</b> The neophyte life is destroyed and God demands virtue. For the neophyte, MUST be a story about justice.

        <H4>Never obey God's religion</H4>
        If the neophyte obeys the God's religion, it is the worst scenario as possible.
        <br>
        God will destroy the neophyte's life and will demand virtue.
        If the neophyte is virtuous, God will lose and he will not know why. So, he will destroy the neophyte's life again and again to see who are the Freemasons who are profiting with the God's loses.
        <br>
        The right thing to do is follow the neophyte's religion, not the God's religion. <b>The God of the neophyte's religion will help him.</b>
        <br>
        <i>The future Freemasons, brothers of the neophyte's future lodge, the brothers of his religion will come and aide him without him knowing.</i>

        <H2>Marcelo Costa Toyama's faith test</H2>

        <H3>My Freemason name</H3>
        Everything is decided before the ritual, but the ritual is extremely important.
        The ritual where I became a master mason was corrupted. The ritual was not fair.
        I will never have a fair trail in human law, divine law, or Freemasonry law.
        I could not choose my name, I was baptized <b>Tubalcain</b>.
        <br />
        I am cautions because the Freemasons plotted the destruction of my life up to my deathbed. The Freemasons know things and they try to deviate from my path.
        I am a Freemason and I am a problem to them.
        <br>
        <b><i>I must choose my own path very cautions.</i></b>

        <h3 id="revelations">Revelations</h3>
        My prophecy is the book of revelations from bible (King James Version).
        In my initiation, my enemy is the God's son - Jesus Christ. He is my Freemason twin.

        <h3>Perverted Ritual</h3>
        The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity perverted the faith test.
        <ul>
            <li>God decides how the life of the neophyte is destroyed and reconstructed. See <a href="#revelations">Revelations</a></li>
            <li>Hell does nothing.</li>
            <li>Heaven profits with the destruction of neophyte's life. Debts in the real world are made in the name of the neophyte.</li>
            <li>Heaven does not prevents the worst.</li>
            <li>God demands sins.</li>
            <li>There is no rewards for sins.</li>
            <li>The test never ends.</li>
            <li>The neophyte life is never reconstructed.</li>
        </ul>

        Because the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity demands sins, there is no free will, and the result is determined. In this process, the neophyte is destroyed without mercy/justice/revenge.

        <H3>Watch him became a God</H3>
        If the faith test is never over, debs are made in the name of the neophyte and are never paid. The neophyte becomes each time more powerful, because everybody has something to pay to the neophyte.
        <br>
        The neophyte becomes a god an rise against the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity, not because he choose so, but because everybody has debts to pay to the neophyte and the Catholic Opus Deis god does not stop to destroy the neophyte life and make debts in his name.

        <H3>Great Architect, Judge, God</H3>
        <i>- There are many religions, there are many masonic rites, but the Great Architect, the Judge and God are always the same.</i>
        <blockquote>
            <i>Great Architect</i> - <b>In my case is the Freemason millionaire doctor owner of a hospital. He wants me dead.</b>
            <br>
            <i>Judge</i> - <b>In my case is the Freemason Brazilian Judge. He protects my life.</b>
            <br>
            <i>God</i> - <b>In my case is the Brazilian army. They want me dead.</b>

            - What does it mean?
            <br>

        <H3>Good vs Evil</H3>
        Is the human nature good or evil?
        <br>
        Heaven thinks that human nature is good.
        <br>
        Hell knowns that human nature is evil.
        <br>
        The human acts based on fear and hate.
        <br>
        To do good is a choice, a person must overcome his fear and hate to do good.
        <br>
        In conclusion, human nature is evil. To do good, one must overcome his nature.

        <H3>Hell and Heaven must always have equal forces</H3>
        <blockquote>
            Son of God - fights for Heaven: Jesus Christ
            <br>
            Son of Devil - fights for Hell: Marcelo Costa Toyama
        </blockquote>

        Jesus Christ is a god and a neophyte in the Freemason. This gives a tremendous power to Heaven.
        But when Heaven has a powerful force, Hell must have an equivalent force. I am the equivalent force from Hell.

        <H3>Destruction of initiated religion</H3>
        The faith test is always a religious war between the faith of the god and the faith of the neophyte.
        <br>
        In my case is a religious war against the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity and my primitive Buddhism.
        <br>
        But the Catholic Opus Dei god decided to take an extra step and destroy the religion of the neophyte, both in his heart and in the real world.
        <br>
        The only thing that classified me as a Christian was a Catholic Baptism Certificate. I got divorced from Morgana. The
        Catholic Church does not accept divorced man. So, I am no longer Catholic.
        <br>
        <b>There is a REM meditation that I MUST use to solve my life. It is how i contact other mental states. The Buddhists meditate to achieve other mental states.</b>
        <br>
        I must never follow or practice any other religious rites.
        <br>
        I must never celebrate or do any Christian rites, for example:
        <ul>
            <li>Christmas</li>
            <li>Marriage, not even as a guest</li>
            <li>Baptism</li>
            <li>Misses</li>
            <li>Any Cristian Holidays</li>
        </ul>

        <H3>V.I.T.R.I.O.L</H3>
        I will never have reconciliation, because:
        <ul>
            <li>If I forgive someone, my mind is erased and the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity uses my name to erase all crimes made against me.</li>
            <li>I cannot ask for forgiveness; I did nothing wrong and, in this case, I will be humiliated and the person will have hypnotic power over me.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>This is going to be important in the future.</b>
        <br>
        <i>The voices in my head asked for my interpretation of V.I.T.R.I.O.L.</i>
        <br>
        I guess that for me it means reconciliation with myself. It would means a mind quest deep into my heart and mind.
        <br>
        Search for something that is not right and try to live with it. Reconciliation for me means acceptance. Not try to fix something broken.
        <br>
        <b><i>Maybe V.I.T.R.I.O.L. for me means learning to live with my Dissociative Identity Disorder?</i></b>

        I had a dream where a young Freemason said this is the lesson of Hell. I said, this is nonsense. No one can do what they will. Actions have consequences.

        I had another dream where an old dying Freemason said the sentences bellow:
        <blockquote>
            When nothing is sin, nothing is taboo.

            When your will is what decides what to do, not religion, not laws, not moral.

        <blockquote>
            Always be sincere with yourself
        </blockquote>

        I made my desires to Hell and I was true to myself. As Hell always does, I received my desires in the worst way possible. Now, imagine if I had lied to myself.

        <blockquote>
            Always be responsible for your actions.
            <br>
            Never be a victim.

        I desired what I wanted. Now, imagine if I regretted my desires and had to ask the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity for forgiveness.

            <br>
            What is the religion where the human existence is only suffering?

            Answer: Buddhism
        </blockquote>

        The devils of Buddhism, accordingly, are no the enemies of Buddha, and not even his antagonists, but his ministers and co-workers. They partake of Buddha's nature, for they, too are teachers. They are the rods of punishment, representing the curse of sin, and as such have also been fitly conceived as incarnations of the Bodhi.
        <br>
        In this interpretation, the Buddhist devils cease to be torturers and become instruments of education who contribute their share to the general system of working out the final salvation of man.
        <br>
        Christian salvation consists in an atonement of sin through the bloody sacrifice of a sinless redeemer; Buddhist salvation is attained through enlightenment. Hence Christ is the sufferer, the innocent man who dies to pay with his life the debt of others who are guilty. Buddha is the teacher who by example and instruction shows people the path to salvation.
        <br>

        <blockquote>
            You are in Hell not for your parents' actions, your siblings' actions or your children's actions.

            You are in Hell for your own actions.

        <blockquote>
            The impossible Kietiro's wish to be a king is for Brazil to be a colony under the Japanese Empire.
        </blockquote>

        Kietiro refused to be a Freemason. Kietiro was AMORC - he didn't knew, but this is worser. AMORC is full of Catholics.

        <H3>Sanctum Sanctorum</H3>
        A very important Freemason in Brazil broke his promise and gave to Mario Ywagiro Toyama all the information about Kietiro and the Toyama Family. These papers are kept by the freemasonry in the Sanctum Sanctorum (witch is my mind).

        <br>
        Kietiro Toyama had some terrible predictions and wills. It was important that his will was followed to the letter or none at all - Never leave the interpretation for Lígia Costa Toyama.
        <br>
        My enemies wanted to use Kietiro Toyama birthright but never fulfill his will.
        <br>
        As a result, Kietiro Toyama's birthright is dead forever, his powers are gone.

        <H3>Freemasonry King Tradition</H3>
        To the Freemason king tradition exist, the country must have a king.
        <br>
        The Toyama family swore fealty to the Japan Emperor.
        <br>
        At some moment in the past, some Freemason near the Emperor or the Emperor himself agreed to this.
        <br>
        The Freemason rite where the king tradition is beautiful is from the Grand Lodges.
        <ul>
            <li>Grand Orient is republic.</li>
            <li>Grand Lodges is monarch.</li>
        </ul>
        It seems that in Japan, the daimyo can create lesser daimyos.
        <br>
        The Brazilian Freemasons want to control the Kietiro birthright. The way to control a birthright is destroying Kietiro family and force the heir to marry someone they choose. After all, this is what a birthright is. A right given upon your birth.

        <H3>Things that made the Freemasons kill the Toyama family.</H3>
        <ul>
            <li>The billionaires are after Kietiro's birthright, because it is above human law.</li>
            <li>Kietiro has infinity desires. (When his dreams where destroyed he can make a desire)</li>
            <li>Kietiro desires apply to all his family</li>
            <li>Kietiro have the right to create vassals</li>
            <li>Vassals count as family</li>
            <li>So all the vassals make a desire when Kietiro make a desire</li>
            <li>All vassals must obey Kietiro</li>
            <li>All vassals have the same rights as Kietiro</li>
            <li>Vassals have as much power as Kietiro have. The only obligation is to obey the liege.</li>
        </ul>

        <H3>Elder in the clan</H3>
        In a Japanese family, the eldest male is who rules. In the Japanese culture, the elder man creates the future for his children. Mario Ywagiro Toyama is the eldest if I am the heir of Kietiro. Mario Ywagiro Toyama rules over the Kietiro's birthright, even though Mario has been disinherited by Kietiro.
        <br>
        Kietiro and Tami knew about the destruction of my life, so they took measures. They discovered that they could only desire for bad things for his descendants. All the good desires are destroyed by the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity.
        <br>
        They desired terrible events that will free Marcelo Costa Toyama and Míriam Costa Toyama. They are blessings disguised as disasters.
        <br>
        Only those who know the history of the Toyama family in detail, will comprehend the Kietiro e Tami desires.

        <H3>Heir</H3>

        <blockquote>
            Kietiro sold his should to Shinto Hell and had a plan of revenge against the Brazilian army. The plan could only the fulfilled by the heir that turned his back against the Brazilian army and the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity.
        </blockquote>

        Kietiro's heir inherit everything, so the Brazilian army plan is to kill everyone and leave only the heir and a male son.
        <br>
        The Brazilian army made all Kietiro's sons and daughters disobey Kietiro's rules
        <br>
        Kietiro's father - Ywagiro - make desires for his heir. It was not his mistake; it is the nature of the king to have an heir.
        <br>
        Kietiro's father - Ywagiro - desired that his heir wife must be of a lineage as old and documented as his. This makes virtually impossible to fulfill Kietiro's desire. This desire was meant to force the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity send all the Toyama family back to Japan.
        <br>
        The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity refused to send all the Toyama family back to Japan and told, there will be incest in the Toyama family. Ywagiro or Kietiro couldn't find a spouse as royal as them, so they gave their surname to another family and married their daughter.
        <br>
        The Brazilian army began to destroy and kill his sons and made terrible things to each heir. As a result, Nelson, Eduardo, Mario and Marcelo suffered the same things in life, different experiences, but the same things.
        <br>
        The Brazilian army and the Freemasonry destroyed the Toyama family at the Kietiro's sons generation. Kietiro has no male heir grandson. The Toyama family that are descendants from Kietiro is exterminated.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Nelson, has no male son of Kietiro blood.</li>
            <li>Eduardo, has only Edson as male son. Edson is not mentally able.</li>
            <li>Margaret is a daughter. Woman does not heir nothing from Kietiro birthright.</li>
            <li>Mario was disinherit by Ketiro</li>
            <li>Marcelo is son of Paulo Udo and Lisandra Costa, I have no Kietiro blood.</li>
        </ul>
        Kietiro was left with no heir, he knew that. Kietiro wants and deserve revenge.
        <br>
        Kietiro desired to Hell for Marcelo Costa Toyama to be his heir, even if Marcelo does not fit the rules.
        <br>
        I am no longer Kietiro's Heir.
        <H4>Reasons</H4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Time Bomb:</b> Today is December 30th 2022. I do not have a male baby from a wife with a documented lineage as old as mine, so I am no longer Kietiro's heir.</li>
            <li><b>Gay:</b> Today is January 31th 2023. I had my first homosexual experience. Kietiro does not accept gay/bisexual/lesbian as heirs, so I am no longer Kietiro's heir.</li>
            <li><b>Bonus lesbian:</b> Míriam Costa Toyama is gay/lesbian also. No one is available to be Kietiro's heir.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <H3>They cheated: Kietiro wished for an heir</H3>
        <div>
            The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity said: - Kietiro wished for Hell to Marcelo Costa Toyama to be his heir. No matter what, Marcelo Costa Toyama is his heir.
            <br>
            This is useless. See <a href="#revenge">Revenge</a>
        </div>

        <H4>Never Desire an Heir</H4>
        The Toyama family is gone. There are no more male Toyama grandson. Kietiro did not wanted and heir. He wanted revenge. I will take revenge upon my enemies and Kietiro will be avenged, because are enemies are the same.

        <H3>Dissociative Identity Disorder</H3>
        The voices in my head said that Kietiro had Dissociative Identity Disorder just like me. The same way I am a hacker that destroys the Brazilian army, navy, air-force, Kietiro was a samurai that killed his enemies in the Brazilian army, navy, air-force using a katana at night.
    </div>

    <H3>Family</H3>
    The Kietiro's wishes are for all family.
    <br>
    Kietiro put the family in first place. The Brazilian army make all the family disobey Kietiro. The Brazilian army turned the family against each other. When the family betrayed Kietiro, he forgived the family. Kietiro died bitter and alone. And the family destroyed itself after.
    <br>
    Nelson was killed because he was against the Brazilian dictatorship.
    <br>
    <b>The Brazilian army hates Kietiro, but Kietiro lost for the Brazilian army, so the history records that Kietiro supported the army.</b>
    <br>
    Opening the files about the Toyama's family records will reveal crimes done by the Brazilian army and Brazilian freemasonry using the Toyama family as a scape goat.
    <br>
    When the world see that the Toyama family is a scape goat for the Brazilian army, It will be possible for the Kietiro's descendant think about the real intentions of Kietiro.
    <br>
    Anyone that Kietiro considered family could accomplish his will.
    <br>
    But they are a bunch of motherfuckers that left all over the shoulders of Marcelo Costa Toyama.
    <br>
    They have profit on my despair and sadness.

    <H3>Kietiro, Mario and Mine mistake</H3>
    Kietiro made the same mistake I made. He make agreements with people and not religion. He had some kind of mental disease in the form of the Japanese superstitions / Japanese magic. At the end of his life, Kietiro understood that it is spiritual and not power game.
    <br>
    Mario made the same mistake I made. He saw the terrible things that the Opus Dei Trinity demanded and said, I will not do it.
    <br>
    It only got worse with me.

    <H4>Kietiro lodge</H4>
    To compensate that Kietiro was not a Freemason, they have been guided to have his Shinto group. He had demons, gods, samurai, etc, working for him.
    <br>
    <b>I must not repeat this mistake</b>

    <H3>Shinto Gods</H3>
    Kietiro and Tami are gods because of Shinto. My Grand Grandfather is also one.
    <br>
    Shinto is a religion where you pray to your ancestors to protect and guard the family. A Freemason in Kietiro lifetime, gave the idea of the dead Shinto Toyama family member to become gods.
    To equilibrate the power of the Catholic Opus Dei.
    <br>
    Kietiro and Tami made desires, these desires are written like Japanese Shinto religion and Japanese folklore/superstition and are the will of the gods Kietiro and Tami.
    <br>
    <b>How to become a god after death?</b>
    Kietiro and Tami made agreements with Hell. In dealing with Hell, first you pay and after you receive. Kietiro paid in his life with money/crimes/his life/other family members lifes
    so his desires would be fulfilled after his death.

    <H3>Mario's birthright</H3>
    <ol>
        <li>Kietiro had some kind of alliance with USA.</li>
        <li>Tami told lies after Kietiro's death. Tami told her family was important, not Keitiro's.</li>
        <li>The story about Toyama Tami can give hints about Mario Ywagiro Toyama birthright.</li>

        <blockquote>
            When I became sick, I thought that I had my parents for support - I was wrong.
            <br>
            When I became sicker, I thought that I had my wife for support - I was wrong.
            <br>
            I am alone, there is no one to ask for help.
            <br>
            I must go forward without ever looking back.

        <blockquote>
            You think you are better than it because of your morals.

        My problem is that the personalities are created in response to trauma.
        <br>
        If I am the evilest person as possible, I will not be traumatized.
        <br>
        No matter the evil made against me, I would have done worst already.
        <br>
        But I will always have DID, with minor personalities.

        <H3>Personalities and Marcelo Costa Toyama</H3>
        I have free will, but other personalities have memories, skills and people connections. I want to merge the
        personalities, but no one wants to help us to merge. They do not even us treated for dissociative personality
        disorder. I have Dissociative Identity Disorder, but the personalities does not have free-will, they obey people. I
        am the only one with free-will. With the passing of time, the personalities begin to copy me.

        <H4>Torture</H4>
        The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity deals with my wishes from 2006 until 2009. I am raped, tortured and beaten so the Catholics can renegotiate the therms of the agreements.
        <br>
        Even under torture, the devil is not renegotiating anymore.

        CIA only extracts people on panic. People that want a new life and want to leave all behind. Leave family, friends, job, etc.
        <br>
        Marcelo Costa Toyama is not in panic. He knows that his life is in danger and that his life is going to be destroyed
        no matter what. Nevertheless, Marcelo Costa Toyama is always plotting against the Brazilian military and is always
        plotting against the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity.

        <H4>Project MKULTRA</H4>
        CIA knows what department of CIA is responsible for what is being done with the Marcelo Costa Toyama. It is the Project MKULTRA department. And the CIA hates this department.

        <H4>Fate</H4>
        Marcelo Costa Toyama was meant to be an USA - United States of America spy.
        <br>
        When a country destroys and important person, the CIA saves this person life.
        <br>
        As a result, the person works for the CIA forever.

        <H4>Cicada 3301</H4>
        Marcelo Costa Toyama was recruited by the CIA through the Cicada 3301. He fulfills the missions, but also does only what he wants in the process.

        <H3>Dissociative Personality Disorder</H3>
        I have dissociative personality disorder, but everybody denies. Everybody wants do control me and deny my memories. No one wants to help me merge the personalities.
        <br>
        This gave freedom to the hacker personality to destroy the Brazilian military complex and protect democracy in Brazil forever without suffering consequences.
        <br>
        Only when the personalities are merged and I have a contact with CIA this will end. But nobody wants this end. And this is the only possible end for me.

        <H3>Investigative Reporters</H3>
        The reporters have followed all my life. But they cannot find evidence of my trip to Europe in 2019. Why?
        <br>
        The voices said that during the trip to Europe, the US and France discovered 2 things.
        <br>
        Morgana betrays me all the time and I don't know about it.
        <br>
        I never betray Morgana.
        <br>
        This made United States of America and France change their plans.
        <br>
        What are the US and France plans?

        <H3>Glenn Greenwald</H3>
        The voice said:
        - You want an investigative reporter to research about you. Do you like the Vaza Jato?
        <br>
        - Yes, it was good.
        <br>
        - What do you think about Glenn Greenwald?
        <br>
        - I guess he is good. Let me see. The Wikipedia says he won an award in the United States of America.
        <br>
        - If Glenn won an award in United States of America, why he migrate to Brazil? Well, he is a good report to research about me.
        <br>
        - Good.
        <br>
        <b>Some days/weeks/months after - the passage of time is really hard for me to track</b>
        <br>
        I was walking on parque da marinha in Porto Alegre RS with my father Mario Ywagiro Toyama and Lígia Costa Toyama. It was very early and there was nobody there.
        <br>
        Someone was walking in our direction. It was a young man. When he crossed our path, I heard the devil saying something like:
        <br>
        - Why so much makeup Glenn? You look too much younger!
        <br>
        <b>After this, I discovered that when I meet important people face to face, it opens games in my mind for them</b>
        <br>
        <b>Some months after</b>
        <br>
        - You should investigate the award that Glenn won on the United States of America, you are not going to be happy.
        <br>
        - He won an award for exposing the National Security Agency!!! ahahahahahha.
        <br>
        - The voices says that I stink Central Intelligence Agency, and I summoned Glenn to investigate me!! He should hate me!!!
        <br>
        - But the question remains.... Why did Glenn migrate to Brazil?
        <br>
        <b>Some months after</b>
        <br>
        - I known why Glenn migrate to Brazil. He exposed the National Security Agency; the United States of America must have made his life a living hell in the United States of America.
        <br>
        - I have the same problem, but on the other way around. The Brazilian Army make my life a living hell!!!
        <br>
        <b>Some months after</b>
        <br>
        - I discovered what is happening!!! I summoned the Glenn, the Central Intelligence Agency's favorite reporter to expose the Central Intelligence Agency in Brazil!!!
        <br>
        - Glenn has already exposed the National Security Agency in the United States of America, he knows how to work under the pressure of the high rank politicians and military!!
        <br>

        <b>The followers of Hell manipulate people through magic, superstition and conspiracy theories.</b>

        <H4>Selling your Soul to Hell</H4>

        When a Freemason sells his soul to Hell, he makes a promise that they cannot keep. He only doesn't know at the moment of the deal that he cannot keep.
        <br>
        Forced to maintain a promise he cannot keep; the Freemason must ask GADU for forgiveness.
        <br>
        Only if he keeps his word, at all costs, Hell accepts him.
        <br>
        <i>Keep your promise to Hell is the way of your grand grandfathers.</i>

        <H4>Laws, regulations and edicts</H4>
        To be in Hell, one must follow the Hell's teachings and customs.

        </blockquote>

        <ol>
            <li>Hell is always summoned.</li>
            <li>First you give something to Hell, then Hell gives something to you.</li>
            <li>When You make a deal with Hell, magic/supernatural horrors happen.</li>
            <li>You must commit a crime to enter hell.</li>
            <li>You must not be innocent.</li>
            <li>Hell is a group of criminals.</li>
            <li>Hell is an exclusive club. People fight over the privilege to be in Hell.</li>
            <li>You are guilty of something you did not did.</li>
            <li>You are a hero for your crimes.</li>
            <li>In another terms, you can go to jail if you do not obey Hell.</li>
            <li>You are betrayed (usually sexually) by your wife/husband.</li>
            <li>Heaven demands a humiliation (usually sexual).</li>
        </ol>

        <H4>Teachings</H4>
        When someone sell his/her soul to her in search for power and money, everyone in his/her life betrays the person.
        <br>
        The person dies inside and his soul dies.
        <br>
        This is the way that Hell charges his price.
        <br>
        A person must be dead inside to be able to use reason and not emotion in his choices, if you ask for money and power, it is better to be dead inside.

        <H3>Heaven</H3>
        <b>The followers of Heaven manipulate people through religion and philosophy.</b>
        <br>
        One night I had a dream. In the rite to become a master Freemason, the masters of the lodge said:
        <br>
        - We heard your prayers to GADU; we know how this is important to you. We, your brothers, got together and made it happen. This is our present to you.
        <br>
        The voices in my head said:
        <br>
        - Marcelo Costa Toyama, you will never have this gift.

        <H3>Heaven, Hell and the Worshipful Master</H3>
        When a Master mason becomes a Worshipful Master, he can choose to stay in Heaven or go to Hell.
        <br>
        If the Worshipful Master is a powerful, influent and rich person, he usually chooses to stay in Heaven. He thinks: - I, alone, am powerful and rich. I don't need anybody else.
        <br>
        If the Worshipful Master is not a powerful, influent and rich person, he chooses to go to Hell. He thinks: - I want to fly higher. I need friends. I must make a commitment with Hell.
        <br>
        <b>That is the difference from Worshipful Master from Heaven and Hell.</b>
        <br>
        Each Worshipful Master from Heaven thinks - I don need anybody else.
        <br>
        Each Worshipful Master from Hell thinks - <b>I must stay committed with my friends in Hell</b>.

        <H3>Book of prophecy</H3>
        The book of prophecy is a list of things to do. This list is in my mind.
        <br>
        When some personality says: I desire something. It is saying something about the prophecy book.
        <br>
        Because of Catholic Opus Dei Trinity, destroyed the ritual, my prophecy book has to be fulfilled. I have no free will.
        What happens is: Heaven destroy my life and force me to commit the sin. While I do not commit the sin, my life is
        destroyed. My life only advances when I commit the sin.
        How to fulfill something you don't want to
        <br>
        Catholic Opus Dei Trinity said wrote: The book of Apocalypse is the story of life of Marcelo Costa Toyama.
        <br>
        The United States of America said: The will of the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity must be fulfilled. The United States of
        America will bring the nuclear apocalypse to Brazil.
        <br>
        This is the way to fulfill the book when you don't want to.

        <H4>Reasons to fulfill the book</H4>
        <ul>
            <li> When I fulfill the prophecy book in a satanic way, my mind will become freer and I will become sane.</li>
            <li>The United States of America said that I do impossible acts with self-induced hypnosis and my photographic memory. If I free my mind, become sane and become able to use the hypnosis and photographic memory I will be very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Some personality was initiate in Washing DC in a lodge of Prince Hall and was invited to the Royal Order of Jesters. If I have the memories, I will be able to have live this life.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of sexual stuff in the prophecy book because the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity (Lígia Costa Toyama) wrote. To fulfill those things is the easiest way to free my mind.</li>
        </ul>

        <H3>Since my grand grandfather - Ywagiro</H3>
        The list of things to do is compose only of terrible crimes and sins.
        <br>
        This list comes since from my grand grandfather Ywagiro, at least.
        <br>
        When the item is not fulfilled it comes back to haunt the next Toyama, in this case my offspring.
        <br>
        God put terrible things to do and Kietiro make it worse.
        <br>
        But Kietiro things are blessings in disguise of curses.
        <br>
        To understand Kietiro I must think like and old, proud Japanese, leader of his community
        <br>
        <b>I must fulfill the list so Maya does not have to!</b>
        <br>
        Hell broke all the humans and divine laws. Even the law of Karma - cause and effect.
        <br>
        What is going to happen, is that I will commit a crime, I will go to jail or be prosecuted, and I will commit
        another greater crime to scape jail/prosecution.        
        
        <H2>Notes</H2>
        <ol>
            <li>The catholic Opus Dei Trinity wished for my death in my 40th Birthday. As a result, someone important in Brasilia - I am guessing some high rank officer from Brazilian Army died or is in severe medical condition - try to search for this motherfucker.</li>
            <li>The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity did not killed me on my 40th birthday, so he broke his promise with me. But there are personalities that are younger than 40 years old. I am still in death danger.</li>
            <li>I am hated since I was a child. Opus Dei Catholic God gave me things, but he tells the people around me to steal from me. The other people steal and are punished by an unknown devil. People hate me since I was a child, and not since 2006. Especially rich people.</li>
            <li>I must close the hypnotic doors with Buddhism and hypnosis. The doors are open based in trust and if i want to help the person.</li>
            <li>Rewrite this wiki in Nihongo.</li>
            <li>People around me learn how to use my wishes and leave me in the dark. They enjoy my wishes and leave nothing to me.</li>
            <li>I am fighting for my mental freedom, but everyone will think that I am fighting for money. Take a note, I will be forever insane.</li>
            <li>The demon told me that the evidence against me is obtained by illegal means. This kind of evidence cannot be used in court.</li>
            <li>Pharaoh is more than and story, it is a Freemason rite.</li>
            <li>I can use C/C++ to reprogram my mind. It is a gift from the USA - that will be destroyed in December 30th 2022.</li>
            <li>I made a deal with the USA, everybody else with Brazilian army.</li>
            <li>The Brazilian army will do to Maya and me the same they did with Mario, Lígia and me.</li>
            <li>No God can judge me. Neither GADU, My rite of passage to Master Freemason was not fair. The judgment was not just. God promised in 1986 that if I am a religious innocent man I must go to hell. I am an innocent man and God sent me to heave. God broke his promise. God is all-powerful, all-knowing, all-seeing, if God make a judgment error, he is not any of these things.</li>
            <li>SERPRO was founded during the Brazilian dictatorship. Until today, the military have influence there.</li>
            <li>I am an Assange from Brazil</li>
            <li>Always USA!</li>
            <li>The devil's game is pay for win.</li>
            <li>Never live in the same house with any other person. This destroys my mind.</li>
            <li>Never sleep out of my home.</li>
            <li>Sell apartment and leave the neighborhood Menino Deus.</li>
            <li>Priorize liquid assets.</li>
            <li>Never ask for money - If I really need money, ask the bank (I have bank privileges, lower interests, etc)</li>
            <li>Never ask money from friend or family</li>
            <li>Avoid countries with dictatorship, Brasil, Russia, China. Never travel or make connections in those countries.</li>
            <li>Bem-te-vis told me: - Brazil wants me dead. If One day I manage to scape, I should never come back or call to any relative (including daughter) in Brazil.</li>
            <li>I will never have a fair judgment. Neither in the freemasonry, neither in the human life. My descendants will never have a fair judgment also. Neither in the freemasonry, neither in the human life.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Twins</h2>
        In a Freemason ritual, more than one person can be being initiated, elevates, exalted.
        <br>
        In a Freemason initiation, the neophytes that are initiated together are twin brothers.

        <h2>Number 3</h2>
        In Freemason, the most important rituals are made with 3 initiates. When they are three, it means that the Freemasons have grate plans for them.

        Those are stories that must be fulfilled.
        <br>
        I must take real care about what I watch and read.
        <br>
        And most important of all, the RPGs I play and the RPGs I am the Dungeon Master.
        <br>
        Also, I gave missions using the stories, movies, music and rpgs. People think that I am stupid and don't know anything because of that.
        <br>
        In all games, I am the enemy, the villain. All the games are player vs player.
        <br>
        Yet. Míriam Costa Toyama and Marcelo Costa Toyama play coop video-games every Sunday.

        They invoked the personality and demanded it to program computer code. And another employee of SERPRO received the

        <br>
        But because the personality didn't want to code, the computer program was shitty and full of security bugs.

            </li>
            <li>
                I desire that the Māras break the law of cause and effect. The law of cause and effect states that effect
                comes after the cause.
            </li>
            <li>I desire that information only exist in the human mind.</li>
            <li>
                I desire that Digital Information exists only in the human mind. The hard drive is not the Digital
                Information, the CD is not the Digital Information, the usb drive is not the Digital Information. Digital
                Information such as (digital software, digital movies, digital music, etc) does not exist. It only exists in the
                human mind.
            </li>
            <li>I desire that data is not information. I desire that information is not intelligence.</li>
            <li>
                I desire to act as a Māra powerful enough to destroy the catholic Opus Dei God, to achieve this all my
                descendants will act as Māras.
            </li>
            <li>
                I desire to be a Māra powerful enough to destroy the catholic Opus Dei God, to achieve this all my
                descendants will serve Hell.
            </li>
            <li>
                I desire to be a demon powerful enough to destroy God, to achieve this all my descendants will serve Hell.
            </li>
            <li>I desire that everyone must gain everything through hard work.</li>
            <li>I desire that I must gain my desires and everything else through hard work.</li>
            <li>I desire to write in the future the definition of Magga, the way leading to the cessation of dukkha.</li>
            <li>I desire to write in the future the definition of Nirodha, the cessation of dukkha.</li>

            <li>I desire that Marcelo Costa Toyama must pay for my desires with money.</li>
            <li>I desire that Marcelo Costa Toyama must pay for his desires with money.</li>
            <li>I desire to live my life without regrets. I desire to never regret about anything I have done.</li>
            <li>I desire to have access to top quality medical and recreational marijuana.</li>
            <li>
                I desire to accept that the Kietiro Toyama desire that Marcelo Costa Toyama have katakana and samurai weapons/armor.
            </li>
            <li>
                I desire to obey the orders from Kietiro. I desire to accept the order: Marcelo, go to Japan and study about
                the family origin. You will have time and money, but never family, friends or love.
            </li>
            <li>I desire to fulfill the plan of Kietiro Toyama.</li>
            <li>I desire that the Kietiro's desire about Yakudoshi be completely fulfilled.</li>
            <li>If the prophecy book is not fulfilled, everyone suffers.</li>
            <li>I accept the desire of Kietiro Toyama to have a safe in a bank.</li>
            <li>Everyone must always speak the truth</li>
            <li>
                I desire that months of the year have themes. For example: April - tell truths to Toyama pretending that are lies. May - mothers month. August - mad dog month - It is my month. June - mesinha month. December - It is my month.
            </li>
            <li>
                I desire that hours of the day have themes. For example: 00:00 am to 01:00 am - Witching hour. 03:00 am to 04:00 am - Devil's hour
            </li>
            <li>
                I desire that days of the year have themes. For example: April 1st - Tell truths to Marcelo Costa Toyama that are so awful that he will think they are lies. December 25th - It is the day to crucify Marcelo Costa Toyama. In this day there is a voice of Catholic Opus Dei Trinity in my mind demanding my suicide and that I authorize that the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity use my name to forgive all financial and other types of crimes that people made.
            </li>
            <li>
                I desire that time taken from one hour/day/month must be paid in another hour/day/month.
