    <H3>5.1 Do what thou wilt, that is the whole of the law</H3>
    I had a dream where a young freemason said this is the lesson of Hell. I said, this is nonsense. No one can do what they will. Actions have consequences.
    <br>
    I had another dream where an old dying freemason said the phares bellow:
    <blockquote>
      When nothing is sin, nothing is taboo.
      <br>
      When your will is what decides what to do, not religion, not laws, not moral.

      You are satanist.

    I am not old dying man, but for now I add:

    <blockquote>
      Reason. A satanist act based on reason, not emotions, not dogma.
    </blockquote>

    Since I was a child, there are additional lessons from Hell, usually not given:
    <br><br>
    <b>Always be sincere with yourself.</b>
    <br>
    I made my desires to Hell and I was true to myself. As Hell always does, I received my desires in the worst way possible. Now, imagine if I had lied to myself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Always be responsible for your actions. Never be a victim.</b>
    <br>
    I desired what I wanted. Now, imagine if I regretted my desires and had to ask the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity for forgiveness.

    <H3>5.2 Early Buddhist Texts</H3>

    <blockquote>
      What is the religion where there is only Hell?
      <br>
      What is the religion where the human existence is only suffering?
      <br>
      Answer: Buddhism
    </blockquote>

    The devils of Buddhism, accordingly, are no the enemies of Buddha, and not even his antagonists, but his ministers and co-workers. They partake of Buddha's nature, for they, too are teachers. They are the rods of punishment, representing the curse of sin, and as such have also been fitly conceived as incarnations of the Bodhi.
    <br>
    In this interpretation, the Buddhist devils cease to be torturers and become instruments of education who contribute their share to the general system of working out the final salvation of man.
    <br>
    Christian salvation consists in an atonement of sin through the bloody sacrifice of a sinless redeemer; Buddhist salvation is attained through enlightenment. Hence Christ is the sufferer, the innocent man who dies to pay with his life the debt of others who are guilty. Buddha is the teacher who by example and instruction shows people the path to salvation.

    <H2>6. Kietiro Toyama</H2>

    <blockquote>
      The impossible Kietiro's wish to be a king is for Brazil to be a colony under the Japanese Empire.
    </blockquote>

    Kietiro refused to be a freemason. Kietiro was AMORC - he didn't knew, but this is worser. AMORC is full of Catholics.

    <H3>Sanctum Sanctorum</H3>
    A very important freemason in Brazil broke his promise and gave to Mario Ywagiro Toyama all the information about Kietiro and the Toyama Family. These papers are kept by the freemasonry in the Sanctum Sanctorum (witch is my mind).

    <br>
    Kietiro Toyama had some terrible predictions and wills. It was important that his will was followed to the letter or none at all - Never leave the interpretation for Lígia Costa Toyama.
    <br>
    My enemies wanted to use Kietiro Toyama birthright but never fulfill his will.
    <br>
    As a result, Kietiro Toyama's birthright is dead forever, his powers are gone.

    <H3>6.1 Freemasonry King Tradition</H3>
    To the freemason king tradition exist, the country must have a king.
    <br>
    The Toyama family swore fealty to the Japan Emperor.
    <br>
    At some moment in the past, some freemason near the Emperor or the Emperor himself agreed to this.
    <br>
    The freemason rite where the king tradition is beautiful is from the Grand Lodges.
    <ul>
      <li>Grand Orient is republic.</li>
      <li>Grand Lodges is monarch.</li>
    </ul>
    It seems that in Japan, the daimyo can create lesser daimyos.
    <br>
    The Brazilian freemasons want to control the Kietiro birthright. The way to control a birthright is destroying Kietiro family and force the heir to marry someone they choose. After all, this is what a birthright is. A right given upon your birth.

    <H3>6.2 Things that made the freemasons kill the Toyama family.</H3>
    <ul>
      <li>The billionaires are after Kietiro's birthright, because it is above human law.</li>
      <li>Kietiro has infinity desires. (When his dreams where destroyed he can make a desire)</li>
      <li>Kietiro desires apply to all his family</li>
      <li>Kietiro have the right to create vassals</li>
      <li>Vassals count as family</li>
      <li>So all the vassals make a desire when Kietiro make a desire</li>
      <li>All vassals must obey Kietiro</li>
      <li>All vassals have the same rights as Kietiro</li>
      <li>Vassals have as much power as Kietiro have. The only obligation is to obey the liege.</li>

    </ul>



    <H3>6.3 Elder in the clan</H3>
    In a Japanese family, the eldest male is who rules. In the Japanese culture, the elder man creates the future for his children. Mario Ywagiro Toyama is the eldest if I am the heir of Kietiro. Mario Ywagiro Toyama rules over the Kietiro's birthright, even though Mario has been disinherited by Kietiro.
    <br>
    Kietiro and Tami knew about the destruction of my life, so they took measures. They discovered that they could only desire for bad things for his descendants. All the good desires are destroyed by the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity.
    <br>
    They desired terrible events that will free Marcelo Costa Toyama and Míriam Costa Toyama. They are blessings disguised as disasters.
    <br>
    Only those who know the history of the Toyama family in detail, will compreende the Kietiro e Tami desires.

    <H3>6.4 Heir</H3>

    <blockquote>
      Kietiro sold his should to Shinto Hell and had a plan of revenge against the Brazilian army. The plan could only the fulfilled by the heir that turned his back against the Brazilian army and the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity.
    </blockquote>

    Kietiro's heir inherit everything, so the braizlian army plan is to kill everyone and leave only the heir and a male son.
    <br>
    The Brazilian army made all Kietiro's sons and daughters disobey Kietiro's rules
    <br>
    Kietiro's father - Ywagiro - make desires for his heir. It was not his mistake; it is the nature of the king to have an heir.
    <br>
    Kietiro's father - Ywagiro - desired that his heir wife must be of a lineage as old and documented as his. This makes virtually impossible to fulfill Kietiro's desire. This desire was meant to force the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity send all the Toyama family back to Japan.
    <br>
    The Catholic Opus Deis Trinity refused to send all the Toyama family back to Japan and told, there will be incest in the Toyama family. Ywagiro or Kietiro couldn't find a spouse as royal as them, so they gave their surname to another family and married their daughter.
    <br>
    The Brazilian army began to destroy and kill his sons and made terrible things to each heir. As a result, Nelson, Eduardo, Mario and Marcelo suffered the same things in life, different experiences, but the same things.
    <br>
    The Brazilian army and the freemansory destroyed the Toyama family at the Kietiro's sons generation. Kietiro has no male heir grandson. The Toyama family that are descendants from Kietiro is exterminated.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Nelson, has no male son of Kietiro blood.</li>
      <li>Eduardo, has only Edson as male son. Edson is not mentally able.</li>
      <li>Margaret is a daughter. Woman does not heir nothing from Kietiro birthright.</li>
      <li>Mario was disinherit by Ketiro</li>
      <li>Marcelo is son os Paulo Udo and Lisandra Costa, I have no Kietiro blood.</li>
    </ul>
    Kietiro was left with no heir, he knew that. Kietiro wants and deserve revenge.
    <br>
    Kietiro desired to Hell for Marcelo Costa Toyama to be his heir, even if Marcelo does not fit the rules.
    <br>
    I am no longer Kietiro's Heir.
    <H4>Reasons</H4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Time Bomb:</b> Today is December 30th 2022. I do not have a male baby from a wife with a documented lineage as old as mine, so I am no longer Kietiro's heir.</li>
      <li><b>Gay:</b> Today is January 31th 2023. I had my first homosexual experience. Kietiro does not accept gay/bisexual/lesbian as heirs, so I am no longer Kietiro's heir.</li>
      <li><b>Bonus lesbian:</b> Míriam Costa Toyama is gay/lesbian also. No one is available to be Kietiro's heir.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <H3>6.5 They cheated: Kietiro wished for an heir</H3>
    <div>
      The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity said: - Kietiro wished for Hell to Marcelo Costa Toyama to be his heir. No matter what, Marcelo Costa Toyama is his heir.
      <br>
      This is useless. See <a href="#section35">8.16 Revenge</a>
    </div>

    <H4>Never Desire an Heir</H4>
    The Toyama family is gone. There are no more male Toyama grandson. Kietiro did not wanted and heir. He wanted revenge. I will take revenge upon my enemies and Kietiro will be avenged, because are enemies are the same.

    <H3>6.6 Dissociative Identity Disorder</H3>
    The voices in my head said that Kietiro had Dissociative Identity Disorder just like me. The same way I am a hacker that destroys the Brazilian army, navy, airforce, Kietiro was a samurai that killed his enemies in the Brazilian army, navy, airforce using a Katana at night.
  </div>

  <hr>

  <div id="section15">
    <H3>6.5 Family</H3>
    The Kietiro's wishes are for all family.
    <br>
    Kietiro put the family in first place. The Brazilian army make all the family disobey Kietiro. The Brazilian army turned the family against each other. When the family betrayed Kietiro, he forgived the family. Kietiro died bitter and alone. And the family destroyed itself after.
    <br>
    Nelson was killed because he was against the Brazilian dictatorship.
    <br>
    <b>The Brazilian army hates Kietiro, but Kietiro lost for the Brazilian army, so the history records that Kietiro supported the army.</b>
    <br>
    Opening the files about the Toyama's family records will reveal crimes done by the Brazilian army and Brazilian freemasonry using the Toyama family as a scape goat.
    <br>
    When the world see that the Toyama family is a scape goat for the Brazilian army, It will be possible for the Kietiro's descendant think about the real intentions of Kietiro.
    <br>
    Anyone that Kietiro considered family could accomplish his will.
    <br>
    But they are a bunch of motherfuckers that left all over the shoulders of Marcelo Costa Toyama.
    <br>
    They have profit on my despair and sadness.

    Kietiro made the same mistake I made. He make agreements with people and not religion. He had some kind of mental disease in the form of the Japanese superstitions / Japanese magic. At the end of his life, Kietiro understood that it is spiritual and not power game.
    <br>
    Mario made the same mistake I made. He saw the terrible things that the Opus Dei Trinity demanded and said, I will not do it.

    It only got worse with me.

    Everything is decided before the ritual, but the ritual is extremely important. I must do everything right.

    Becoming a maser mason is a death experience. No master mason goes to Hell. The master mason chooses by his own free will to go to Hell latter in his masonic life.

    But the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity determined that If Marcelo Costa Toyama is an innocent religious person he would go to Hell and if he was guilt, he would go to Heaven.

    At the moment I became a master mason I was an inocent religious person and as the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity determined I should go to Hell.

    But the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity broke his word and sent me to Heaven.

    Because the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity broke his own laws, the judgment was unfair. As a result, I will never have a fair judgment in regular life or masonic life.

    <H4>Selling your Soul to Hell</H4>
    <blockquote>
      You are in Hell not for your parents' actions, your siblings' actions or your children's actions.
      <br>
      You are in Hell for your own actions.
      <br>
      - Buddha
    </blockquote>

    When a freemason sells his soul to Hell, he makes a promise that they cannot keep. He only doesn't know at the moment of the deal that he cannot keep.
    <br>
    Forced to maintain a promise he cannot keep; the freemason must ask GADU for forgiveness.
    <br>
    Only if he keeps his word, at all costs, Hell accepts him.
    <br>
    <i>Keep your promise to Hell is the way of your grand grandfathers.</i>

    To be in Hell, one must follow the Hell's teachings and customs.

      <li>When You make a deal with Hell, magic/supernatural horrors happen.</li>
      <li>You must commit a crime to enter hell.</li>

    <H4>Teachings</H4>
    When someone sell his/her soul to her in search for power and money, everyone in his/her life betrays the person.
    <br>
    The person dies inside and his soul dies.
    <br>
    This is the way that Hell charges his price.
    <br>
    A person must be dead inside to be able to use reason and not emotion in his choices, if you ask for money and power, it is better to be dead inside.

    When a Master mason becomes a Worshipful Master, he can choose to stay in Heaven or go to Hell.

    <br>
    If the Worshipful Master is not a powerful, influent and rich person, he chooses to go to Hell. He thinks: - I want to fly higher. I need friends. I must make a commitment with Hell.

    When Hell decides that the neophyte is a good person, a person of faith, the test ends.

    After the end of the test, Heaven can reconstruct the neophyte life and there is V.I.T.R.I.O.L.

    The human acts based on fear and hate.
    <br>
    To do good is a choice, a person must overcome his fear and hate to do good.

  <div id="section84">
    <H3>14.8 Religious War</H3>
    The faith test is always a religious war. It is a war of the God's religion and the neophyte's religion.
    <br>
    If the God's religion and the neophyte's religion is the same, it is called Sponsorship and is the worst scenario as
    possible.
    <br>

    <H4>God's religion</H4>
    God destroys the life of the neophyte and demands conversion to his religion.
    <br>
    The right thing to do is follow the neophyte's religion, not the God's religion.
    <br>
    The God of the neophyte's religion will help him.
    <br>
    The future freemasons, brothers of the neophyte's future lodge, the brothers of his religion will come and aide him
    without him knowing.

    <H4>Sponsorship</H4>
    When the God's religion and the neophyte's religion are the same, God has all the power. God can destroy the
    neophyte or can be merciful and save him.
    <br>
    In this scenario:
    <ol>
      <li>The neophyte cannot ask for his God help, Afterall is the same God that is destroying his life.</li>
      <li>The neophyte cannot as for help from his religious community, Afterall they will help God destroy the neophyte life and will not help the neophyte.</li>
      <li>The freemasons will play harder, forcing always the destruction of the life of the neophyte for profit. Forcing God do end the faith test.</li>
    </ol>

    <H4>Patronage</H4>
    <b>When the God religion is the same of the neophyte, this is not seen in good eyes by the freemasons. This is called patronage and there is no religious war.</b>

    <H4>Power Struggle</H4>
    <b>To the neophyte is a religious experience. He must be faithful to his own religion, not the God's religion.</b>
    <br>
    To everyone else, God, the freemasons, the future lodge, is a power game.
    <br>
    It is a hidden war between the God and the freemasons. And the freemasons profit destroying and saving the life of the neophyte.

    <H4>Never obey God's religion</H4>
    If the neophyte obeys the God's religion, it is the worst scenario as possible.
    <br>
    God will destroy the neophyte's life and will demand virtue.
    <br>
    If the neophyte is not virtuous, he will be punished.
    <br>
    If the neophyte is virtuous, God will lose and he will not know why. So, he will destroy the neophyte's life again
    and again to see who are the freemasons who are profiting with the God's loses.

    <H3>14.9 God vs God</H3>
    God thinks that is only powerful person playing and is teaching a game of power to the neophyte withe the excuse of
    knowing if he is good or evil.
    <br>
    The religion of God is always diferente of the religion of the neophyte.
    <br>
    It is always a religious war.
    <br>
    God thinks that he is alone playing the game.
    <br>
    God destroys the life of the neophyte and demands to follow Gods religion.
    <br>
    The answer if the neophyte follows its own religion and the future lodge, the brothers of faith of the neophyte,
    help him. Respecting the Heaven and Hell analogy. In truth, God is playing a power game against the freemasonry.

    <H3>14.10 Toyama's faith test</H3>
    My initiation rite is the Book of Job from the Bible (New King James Version).
    <br>
    My initiation is very rigid, but this is because of me.
    <br>
    I said that everyone must keep their promises and I always keep my promises. This makes everything hard and rigid
    for everyone.
    <br>
    My book of law is the book of revelations from bible (king James Version). (Think about the implications!)
    <br>
    'Kietiro Toyama sold me to Hell. God with his infinity wisdom said: - Heaven will act as Hell and Hell will act as
    Heaven. But Hell never obeyed and continue to act as Hell.
    <br>
    Because of God's decision, Heaven and Hell must destroy my life, and no one can save me.
    <br>
    In my initiation, my enemy is the God's son.
    <br>
    I am doomed by design. My life will be destroyed, no possessions, no dreams, no family, no friends. I will end
    insane.
    <br>
    The voices in my head say that my friend Alex was making sex with Dani while she was my girlfriend. The history
    always makes me remember, I am only betrayed by friends and girlfriends.
    <br>
    Catholic Opus Dei are a mother fucker
    <ul>
      <li>The faith test ends on my biological death day.</li>
      <li>I can only know the truth when the faith test is over</li>
      <li>God destroy my life until the faith test is over, when the test is over, he can rebuild my life.</li>
    </ul>

    God gave his word; he decided when I was a child. - If Toyama is an honest and religious man, he goes to Hell.
    <br>
    God broke his word. I am a religious honest man in Heaven. God broke his word, so he cannot judge me never more.
    <br>
    The faith test does not help and is destroying everyone, not just me.
    <br>
    But God gave his word, the fait test ends in my biological death day. If he broke his word, he will be punished.
    <br>
    The faith test has no value, because the trail In the Lodge Pitágoras was not fair. The prophecy book has to be
    fulfilled; people must keep their word.
    <br>
    The end of the faith test is the day of my biological death, where I will know if there is heaven and hell.
    <br>
    Or
    <br>
    At the day of ritual where I became Master Mason, but the judgement in the ritual was unfair, so nobody has the
    right to judge me nevermore.
    <br>
    <b>Never go back to any freemason rite, my judgement in the ritual where I became Master Mason was unfair, this will destroy my future in any freemason rite. </b>

    <H4>Perverted Ritual</H4>
    The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity perverted the faith test. It should be this way:
    <ul>
      <li>God decides how the life of the nophyte is destroyed.</li>
      <li>Hell profits with the destruction of neophyte's life. Debts in the real world are made in the name of the neophyte.</li>
      <li>Heaven prevents the worst.</li>
      <li>God demands virtue.</li>
      <li>Hell gives rewards for sins.</li>
      <li>Hell decides that the test is over.</li>
      <li>Heaven profits with the reconstruciton of the neophyte's life. The Debts in the real world are payed to the neophyte.</li>
    </ul>
    In this process the neophyte must choose between good and evil.
    <br>
    The fait test was perverted this way:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Heaven destroys the life of the initiated.</li>
      <li>Hell does nothing.</li>
      <li>god demands sins.</li>
      <li>There is no reward for the sins.</li>
      <li>The test never ends.</li>
    </ul>
    Because the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity demands sins, there is no free will, and the result is determined.
    <br>
    In this process, the neophyte is destroyed without mercy/justice/revenge.

    <H4>Watch him became a God</H4>
    If the faith test is never over, debs are made in the name of the neophyte and are never paid. The neophyte becomes each time more powerful, because everybody has something to pay to the neophyte.
    <br>
    The neophyte becomes a god an rise against the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity, not because he choose so, but because everybody has debts to pay to the neophyte and the Catholic Opus Deis god does not stop to destroy the neophyte life and make debts in his name.
  </div>

  <H4>Destruction of initiated religion</H4>
  The faith test is always a religious war between the faith of the god and the faith of the neophyte.
  <br>
  In my case is a religious war against the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity and my primitive Buddhism.
  <br>
  But the Catholic Opus Deis god decided to take an extra step and destroy the religion of the neophyte, both in his heart and in the real world.
  <br>
  The only thing that classified me as a Christian was a Catholic Baptism Certificate. I got divorced from Morgana. The
  Catholic Church does not accept divorced man. So, I am no longer Catholic.
  <br>
  <b>There is a REM meditation that I MUST use to solve my life. It is how i contact other mental states. The Buddhists meditate to achieve other mental states.</b>
  <br>
  I must never follow or practice any other religious rites.
  <br>
  I must never celebrate or do any Christian rites, for example:
  <ul>
    <li>Christmas</li>
    <li>Marriage, not even as a guest</li>
    <li>Baptism</li>
    <li>Missas</li>
    <li>Any Cristian Holydays</li>
  </ul>

  <H4>Early Buddhist Texts</H4>

  <H4>Me and the other people</H4>
  By old agreements I am the God in the faith test of everyone. And my religion is Early Buddhist Texts.
  <br>
  By old agreements everybody is the God in my faith test. And the test are stories where I lose everything. My movies, music and comic books are the faith test of the other gods.
  <br>
  In 2009, my family discovered that the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity had terrible plans for every member of Toyama family, not just my parents and siblings. But they tought that I was demanding that, and not the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity.
  <br>
  They decided, Marcelo Costa Toyama will have multiple fates. He will suffer the fate of each family/friend/lover instead of that person. This made me have multiple personality disorder.

  <H4>V.I.T.R.I.O.L</H4>
  I will never have reconciliation, because:
  <ul>
    <li>If I forgive someone, my mind is erased and the Catholic Opus Dei Trinity uses my name to erase all crimes made against me.</li>
    <li>I cannot ask for forgiveness; I did nothing wrong and, in this case, I will be humiliated and the person will have hypnotic power over me.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>This is going to be importante in the future.</b>

  <i>The voices in my head asked for my interpretation of V.I.T.R.I.O.L.</i>
  I guess that for me it means reconciliation with myself. It would means a mindquest deep into my heart and mind. Search for something that is not right and try to live with it. Reconciliation for me means acceptance. Not try to fix something broken.
  <b><i>Maybe V.I.T.R.I.O.L. for me means learning to live with my Dissociative Identity Disorder?</i></b>

    Because of Catholic Opus Dei Trinity, destroyed the ritual, my prophecy book has to be fulfilled. I have no free will.

    How to fulfill something you don't want to

    <ol>
      <li>The catholic Opus Dei Trinity wished for my death in my 40th Birthday. As a result, someone important in Brasilia - I am guessing some high rank officer from Brazilian Army died or is in severe medical condition - try to search for this motherfucker.</li>
      <li>The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity did not killed me on my 40th birthday, so he boke his promisse with me. But there are personalities that are younge than 40 years old. I am still in death danger.</li>
      <li>I am hated since I was a child. Opus Dei Catholic God gave me things, but he tells the people around me to steal from me. The other people steal and are punished by an unknown devil. People hate me since I was a child, and not since 2006. Especially rich people.</li>
      <li>I must close the hypnotic doors with Buddhism and hypnosis. The doors are open based in trust and if i want to help the person.</li>
      <li>Rewrite this wiki in Nihongo.</li>
      <li>People around me learn how to use my wishes and leave me in the dark. They enjoy my wishes and leave nothing to me.</li>
      <li>I am fighting for my mental freedom, but everyone will think that I am fighting for money. Take a note, I will be forever insane.</li>
      <li>The demon told me that the evidence against me is obtained by illegal means. This kind of evidence cannot be used in court.</li>
      <li>Pharao is more than and story, it is a freemason rite.</li>
      <li>I can use C/C++ to reprogram my mind. It is a gift from the USA - that will be destroyed in December 30th 2022.</li>
      <li>I made a deal with the USA, everybody else with Brazilian army.</li>
      <li>The Brazilian army will do to Maya and me the same they did with Mario, Ligia and me.</li>
      <li>No God can judge me. Neither GADU, My rite of passage to Master Freemason was not fair. The judgment was not just. God promised in 1986 that if I am a religious inocente man I mut go to hell. I am an inocente man and God sent me to heave. God broke his promise. God is all-powerful, all-knowing, all-seeing, if God make a judgment error, he is not any of these things.</li>
      <li>SERPRO was founded during the Brazilian dictatorship. Until today, the military have influence there.</li>
      <li>I am an Assange from Brazil</li>
      <li>Always USA!</li>
      <li>The devil's game is pay for win.</li>
      <li>Never live in the same house with any other person. This destroys my mind.</li>
      <li>Never sleep out of my home.</li>
      <li>Sell apartment and leave the neighborhood Menino Deus.</li>
      <li>Priorize liquid assets.</li>
      <li>Never ask for money - If I really need money, ask the bank (I have bank privilegies, lower interests, etc)</li>
      <li>Never ask money from friend or family</li>
      <li>Avoid countries with dictatorship, Brasil, Russia, China. Never travel or make connections in those countries.</li>
      <li>Bem-te-vis told me: - Brazil wants me dead. If One day I manage to scape, I should never come back or call to any relative (including daughter) in Brazil.</li>
      <li>I will never have a fair judgement. Neither in the freemasonry, neither in the human life. My descendants will never have a fair judgment also. Neither in the freemasonry, neither in the human life.</li>

    <H2>What I know about the enemy - Stories</H2>
    The movies I saw, the books I read, the RPG I play gives power to Lígia Costa Toyama.
    <br>
    Those are stories that must be fulfilled.
    <br>
    I must take real care about what I watch and read.
    <br>
    And most important of all, the RPGs I play and the RPGs I am the Dungeon Master.
    <br>
    Also, I gave missions using the stories, movies, music and rpgs. People think that I am stupid and don't know
    anything because of that.
    <br>
    In all games, I am the enemy, the vilan. All the games are player vs player.
    <br>
    Yet. Míriam Costa Toyama and Marcelo Costa Toyama play coop videogames every sunday.

    <H2>What I know about the enemy - Mental States</H2>
    There is information in my mind that unlocks given my conscious and subconscious choices.
    <br>
    There is going to never stop the leaking of information from my mind.
    <br>
    When someone gives an order and the alter yells "free will violation", it is very difficult for me to obtain the

      The Catholic Opus Dei Trinity destroys my life every time. Even in the most insignificant and little moments.
      <br>
      Like my daughter's birthday.
      <br>
      If you have no HOPE, you cannot lose anything.
    </blockquote>
    I am an internet God.
    <br>
    Do everything online.
    <br>
    I must make everything online. Do not invest on Buddhism on Brazil or EUA or Europe.
    <br>
    Invest on online things without country.
    <br>
    The same thing goes for bank, religion, job, etc.

    <H2>What I know about the enemy - They made me work for free</H2>
    They put me to code program in SERPRO without me knowing it.
    <br>
    They invoked the personality and demanded it to program computer code. And another employee of SERPRO received the
    merit.
    <br>
    But because the personality didn't want to code, the computer program was shitty and full of security bugs.
    <br>

    <H3>To be proven</H3>
    If Marcelo Costa Toyama is really a hacker, He could be doing things like the bellow with the shitty programs he was
    forced to code.
